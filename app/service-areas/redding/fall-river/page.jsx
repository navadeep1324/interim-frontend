                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_River_Mills,_California" className="phone-link" target="_blank">Fall River</a> is a city located in Shastha County, US. It is a remote area with an age dependency ratio of  <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/california/fall-river-mills" className="phone-link" target="_blank">74.8%</a>, meaning most of the senior population depends on working-age population for support.  This high dependency has increased the demand of senior home care services in Fall River. Interim Healthcare aims to bridge this gap by offering senior care services in the comfort of your loved one’s own home.  
                </p>
                <p>Our goal is to ensure that every senior in Fall River lives their life to the fullest. Whether it's assistance with daily activities, companionship, or specialized home health care. We are committed to enhancing the lives of elders with personalized and attentive care.  </p>
